designed to get\n                students all over the world excited about computing. The\n                challenge is a great way to learn about computational thinking\n                and problem solving skills. The Bebras challenges are made of a\n                set of short problems called Bebras tasks. The tasks are fun,\n                engaging and based on problems that Computer Scientists enjoy\n                solving. The tasks require logical thinking and can be solved\n                without prior knowledge of computational thinking.
