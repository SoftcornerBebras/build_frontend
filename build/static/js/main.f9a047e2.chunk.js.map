The\n                challenge is a great way to learn about computational thinking\n                and problem solving skills. The Bebras challenges are made of a\n                set of short problems called Bebras tasks. The tasks are fun,\n                engaging and based on problems that Computer Scientists enjoy\n                solving. The tasks require logical thinking and can be solved\n                without prior knowledge of computational thinking. The aim is to\n                solve as many as you can in the allotted time.\n              </h5>\n            </GridItem>\n          </div>\n        </GridContainer>\n        <GridContainer>\n          <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={6}>\n            <br></br>\n            <br></br>\n            <br></br>\n\n            <div\n              style={{\n                borderRadius: \"59% 41% 48% 52% / 30% 51% 49% 70%\",\n                backgroundColor: \"#d19592\",\n                backgroundImage:\n                  \"linear-gradient(315deg, #63a4ff 0%, #83eaf1 74%)\",\n                width: \"83%\",\n                height: \"76%\",\n              }}\n            >\n              <InfoArea\n                title=\" Bebras is an international initiative aiming to promote Informatics (Computer Science, or Computing) and computational thinking among school students at all ages.
